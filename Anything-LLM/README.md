## Deploy with Portainer

1. In Portainer, open **Stacks** and choose **Add stack**.
2. Use the folder name from this repo as the stack name, then paste or upload the `docker-compose.yaml` from this directory.
3. Replace placeholders such as `changeme`, `/path/to/your/data`, `your-*`, and any `${ENV_VAR}` values.
4. Create any required bind-mount paths, datasets, secrets, and external Docker networks before deployment.
5. Deploy the stack, then check **Container logs**, **Health**, and published ports in Portainer.

## Warnings & gotchas

- Replace all placeholders (`changeme`, `/path/to/your/data`, `your-*`, `${...}`) before deploying.
